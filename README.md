Configs that I personally use @ work and for personal matters»ò

- Visual Studio Code [ [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) ]
    - ESLint extension
    - Material Icon Theme extension
    - Prettier - Code formatter extension
- Regarding how I handle git operations, on my **Windows** machine I use **Gitbash** [ [Download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) ]. 

What is Gitbash? Git Bash is an application for Microsoft Windows environments which provides an emulation layer for a Git command line experience. As you probably learned in our previous labs, from time to time we use the Git commands (such as ```git add .```, ```git commit -m "message"```, ```git push```) in order to commit our code to a selected repository. So basically, Gitbash helps us emulate that terminat that you typically used in the CodeSandbox terminal.

- For **Windows** but also very recommended for **MacOS**, **Sourcetree** [ [Download here](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) ] is also a nice tool to use.

Sourcetree is a friendly interface where no git terminal commands are actually used by the developer, instead you have user friendly buttons for your commands.

- Specific for **MacOS** users, if you want to go rogue and use the terminal, I recommend installing **iTerm 2** for your daily use instead of the common MacOS terminal. Also, you will have to have [brew](https://brew.sh/index_ro) installed in order to get Xcode Developer tools so that you can use the git commands directly in the terminal without any other emulation layer needed.
